# Multi-Variable Regression Analysis

This repository contains a Python notebook that performs multi-variable regression analysis using the `statsmodels` library. It is an exploratory data analysis project that uses the Boston House Prices dataset.

## Overview

The notebook begins with data loading and preprocessing, using the pandas library to handle the dataset. Next, it performs some exploratory data analysis, including calculating descriptive statistics and creating some visualizations. The notebook then proceeds to build a multi-variable linear regression model, interpreting the output and checking the assumptions of linear regression.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/j-breedlove/predict_house_prices.git
```
2. Change directory
```bash
cd predict_house_prices
```
## Dependencies

The main libraries used in this notebook are:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels

## How to Run

To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter installed. If you do not have Jupyter, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install jupyter
```

You will also need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```

Once you have Jupyter and the required libraries installed, you can start Jupyter by navigating to the directory containing the notebook and running:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will start the Jupyter server and open a page in your web browser. From there, you can open the notebook and run the cells.

## Notebook Content

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data loading and preprocessing**: In this section, the Boston House Prices dataset is loaded and preprocessed. It is checked for missing values, and descriptive statistics are calculated.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Here, the data is explored and visualized using seaborn and matplotlib.

3. **Multi-variable linear regression analysis**: In this part, a multi-variable linear regression model is built using the `statsmodels` library. The output of the model is interpreted and the assumptions of linear regression are checked.
